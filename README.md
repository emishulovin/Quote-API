Quote API enables a user to request famous computer programming quotes! 

It uses Express.js and has a simple CRUD interface that complies with REST-API architecture. This is derived from the Codecademy 'quote-api-starting' project. 

You can use Postman ('https://www.postman.com/') to submit CRUD requests.
